# Unity Support Textures Generators

This project is a compilation of tools to generate textures like noise textures, gradients and modify such textures. It's very common to use them in shaders or other procedural generation, so I think having tools to deal with them directly in Unity would be of great use.

All of this would never be possible without the awesome open source community. None of the noise generation algorithms used are mine.

- [Justin (Scrawk)](https://github.com/Scrawk/GPU-Voronoi-Noise) for this awesome Voronoi noise generation code.
